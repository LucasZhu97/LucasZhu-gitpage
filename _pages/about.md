I am a senior majoring Computer Engineering at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/). My primary research interest lies in the broad fields of computer systems and architectures. I am attracted by the design challenges spawned by demanding computational needs at the age of artificial intelligence. My goal is to design and build generic and efficient systems across the layers of current abstractions between user and software stack.
